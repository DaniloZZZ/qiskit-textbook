    "Notice how we are concered with the tensor product of two states for each term in the sum (we are concerned with two different systems of qubits, register $A$ and register $B$). We also define $H_A$ to be the Hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the qubits in the first register, with $H_A |E_n\\rangle_A \\ = \\ E_n |E_n\\rangle_A$, thus making our TFD state depend on both the energy eigenstates and the energy eigenvalues. It is also important to note that $\\beta$ is defined as the inverse temperature of the system that we are describing, $\\beta \\ = \\ 1/T$. $Z(\\beta)$ denotes the partition function, which is given by:\n",
